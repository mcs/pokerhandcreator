# Pokerhandcreator

## Vision
Provide a way to manually enter a single poker hand and get a valid PokerStars hand history file.

There are many useful services out there which rely on a poker hand history file. Personally, I 
want to create some training hands for coaching purposes. I want to present them with the 
[Universal Replayer](http://www.universal-replayer.net/)
which seems to be a nice offline client for discussing poker hands. Sadly, it does not allow manual 
hand creation, but needs a hand history from one of the big online poker programs.

In order to add non-played hands, I started this project. Let's see if / when it will be finished :-)

Currently I am just planning to support Texas Hold'em No-Limit.

## Used tools / frameworks
I am planning to use the following software stack:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
1. [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
1. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Off topic
I have never used JavaScript as backend language, so don't expect too much from the source code.
For me this is a learning project, too. Any feedback regarding the code is highly appreciated :-)
